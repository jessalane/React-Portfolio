          <p>
            My start with coding came from an impractical source. I began playing games on forums at around the age of thirteen, and over time I learned to design my own code for them. It was something that was always just a hobby to me. I did it because I enjoyed the challenge of teaching myself, and I was good at it.

            While it took me a fair bit of time to realize it was something I could pursue as a career, I've been enjoying the journey of developing my skills in the field, and look forward to finding a company as invested in my growth as I am.
